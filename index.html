                <h3 class="section-subtitle">Our Story</h3>
                <p>The story of Montheri Trading began in 2015 when it was registered with CIPC. It is no surprise that those years have been used optimally to surpass expectations and still aim higher with the passing of every milestone.</p>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Montheri Trading has, for the past 5 years, utilised over 100 years of industry experience by bringing in notable industry pacesetters to partner up and provide end-to-end solutions to challenges facing the customer.</p>

                <h3 class="section-subtitle">Our Directors' Expertise</h3>
                <p>Our Directors have a string of successful projects under their belts in the industries we operate in and it is this wealth of knowledge that we tap into to not only see where we are going but also forecast where we need to position ourselves for maximum ascendancy for the benefit of our clients, employees and the industry we serve in.</p>

                <h3 class="section-subtitle">Our Business Focus</h3>
                <p>Our interests in commodity trading put us right in the front line of extracting commodities, moving goods and ensuring productivity in mining and road transportation. This is a business that introduces us to the vast opportunities that exist in these economy-bench-marking activities.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">We offer an extensive range of commodities and continuously invest in new machinery that is befitting of the broadness of our reach.</p>

                <h3 class="section-subtitle">Our Reach</h3>
                <p>We can service clients in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, Namibia and Swaziland. Through our network of industry-based relationships we are also able to take on projects in most parts of the continent. Our reach is limited only by the depth of our relationships and we take great pride in having strong ties with reputable companies, individuals and government entities.</p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">The work we have completed these past five years is a great reference of our capabilities to deliver well every time. Our plan for the next five years is to build on that positive momentum for our prosperity. Is there any other way to do business? At Montheri Trading we don't think so.</p>

This is a promise to always do business with honesty and the preservation of what will remain long after the last seeds we have planted have matured and the last piece of precious mineral dug out from the ground - that is human life.</p>
                        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">The communities we work with, the people we empower and the environment we have to preserve. As Montheri Trading we are always looking at new ways to minimise our footprint on human life and the surroundings we rely on to thrive.</p>

                        <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">Planning is not a discipline of ideals and best case scenarios but an anticipation of every little detail of the things we can control and those we cannot.</p>

                <p>Our clients are mining companies, construction companies, trucking companies and companies that trade in low value and high value commodities. We work on reputation more than anything. The reputation of Montheri Trading as a company, the reliability of our machines and the careful planning of our processes. We do not market ourselves conventionally since we target key decision makers of the companies and entities we aim to do business with.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">We have worked on a marketing approach based on relationship building and networking instead of conventional "cast the net wide" marketing practices. The benefit of this is cost reduction and targeted spending.</p>

                    <h4 style="color: var(--primary-red); margin: 2rem 0 1rem;">Project Significance</h4>
                    <p>Our first project and why we hold it dear to our hearts and as an integral part of our history is the Contract Mining project for Natal Portland Cement in KwaZulu Natal. This project established our reputation in the industry.</p>

                    <h4 style="color: var(--primary-red); margin: 2rem 0 1rem;">Technical Challenges</h4>
                    <p>In this project we were tasked with extracting 10,000 tonnes of de-dolomitised limestone monthly. We were working alongside the main contractor, Unitrans, where we were tasked with extracting this metamorphic rock which meant we had to work around the challenges that come with such rocks in the form of fault lines and imperfections in the formation.</p>

                    <h4 style="color: var(--primary-red); margin: 2rem 0 1rem;">Key Achievements</h4>
                    <ul class="styled-list">
                        <li>Successfully completed 3-year contract with zero safety incidents</li>
                        <li>Consistently met monthly production targets of 10,000 tonnes</li>
